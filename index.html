				Here on this website I will share with you some of my favorite cooking recipes.
				A lot of them are vegetarian alternatives and I hope you enjoy them (if the recipes just aren't vegetarian enough or you find the food more appealing outside of vegetarian dishes feel free to change the recipes!)
				You can find some vegan versions of many of these dishes as well. Here's some tips for what to expect in each dish - and please forgive the sometimes messy photos!
				Many of the dishes serve 2 to 5 people. They are delicious and great to cook.
				If you can't find the dishes listed here, visit our favorite locations for quick and affordable comfort food.

			<h2>Cooking tip of the day!</h2>
			<p>
				This is a tip for cooking: <strong>Cooking can get messy sometimes!</strong>
				To save yourself a lot of time, I recommend that you use the following trick to eat the right way!
			</p>
			<p>
				How to prepare soup / stewing meat: to prepare stewing meat, first chop it into very small pieces.
				Cook it without any oil or fat until it will become very tender.
				So the soup goes very nice after its cooking time.

			<h2>More about cooking</h2>
			<p>
				As much as fun it might be, when it comes to cooking, there really is only one rule:
				<ul>
					<li>Don't make a mess</li>
					<li>If you love what you're doing, then please don't break anything (even if that means throwing away all your fancy tools).</li>
					<li>If it takes another person to not make a mess, then bring them along.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>About me!</h2>
			<p class='aboutme'>
				I love to bake. I'm self taught. I bake about 2-3 times a week. I bake at my home, so I know what I like to bake. I'm always experimenting with new ways to make different cakes, but it isn't until you come home from a weekend bake off
				where I truly know what I want to make.

				I want to bake for myself. Whether it is for my wedding or for special occasions, I want to make something special that my friends and family can appreciate. This means taking great care, using ingredients that I LOVE, experimenting to find out
				which ingredients work best, making sure my home baking is fun and my friend's experience is perfect.

				When I work on my cakes, I really enjoy the challenges. You need to make the cakes with the correct oven temp, but you can also make them in the oven at 500¬∞F. I also love to cook when the temperature is above 150¬∞F, and I try to cook the cakes
				at an oven temperature of 800¬∞F. I try to bake cakes that are not too sweet for my guests, but you do want to go a little crazy and make different cakes sometimes. This way, you don't have
				to let your guests eat the very same cake every week.
